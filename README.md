# Usage

# Things I learned

Never built a RESTFUL API before so this is my first time, this helped me a [lot](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/how-to-build-a-restful-api-using-node-js-express-mongodb-1882a966726c)
Since this isn't Ruby on Rails, you have to configure a lot of things like establishing the connection to MongoDB, and then setting up the middleware so that Express doesn't stop working, then setting up the model which specifies the structure of how data will be indexed, and then the controller which deals with how requests are being handled
