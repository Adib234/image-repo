# Learning a thing or two about image classification using ImageAI :)

Hope this goes well, it's my first time learning and using image classification, the baboon image worked but the picture of myself for some reason was a suit????

If you do end up cloning this repository just run this command and that should install all the required dependencies (there's a lot of them), make sure to have Python 3.6-3.8 because apparently on Stack Overflow, as of October 2020, that's only what Tensorflow supports.
