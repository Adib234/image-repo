# Learning a thing or two about image classification using ImageAI :)

Hope this goes well, it's my first time learning and using image classification, the baboon image worked but the picture of myself for some reason was a suit????

If you do end up cloning this repository just run this command and that should install all the required dependencies (there's a lot of them), make sure to have Python 3.6-3.8 because apparently on Stack Overflow, as of October 2020, that's only what Tensorflow supports.

Oof the ResNet50 model file is exceeding Github's recommended size, might consider putting it in my .gitignore and just providing a link to the model file over here (EDIT: yup I did just (that)[https://github.com/OlafenwaMoses/ImageAI/blob/master/imageai/Classification/README.md])
